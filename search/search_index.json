WSL2 enables users to run Linux applications and use command-line tools natively on their Windows machines. This integration allows users to enjoy the familiarity of Windows while simultaneously harnessing the power and flexibility of Linux. Also, a surprising number of Linux GUI apps can run on WSL. GUI applications are officially supported on WSL2 and referred to as WSLg(No installation required).</p> macOS Linux Windows with WSL Advantages (+) Excellent for coding and video editing. Supports Adobe &amp; Office products. (+) Ideal for coding and gaming, providing good performance in both areas. - (+) Seamless compatibility with diverse software, including Adobe &amp; Office products.  (+) Optimal choice for gaming enthusiasts  (+) Well-suited for coding with Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and no need for dual boot. Inconvenient (-) Limited gaming capabilities compared to Windows &amp; Linux. (-) Lacks support for Adobe &amp; Office products and certain software. (-) UI is not smooth and responsive compared to macOS &amp; Linux <p>Within the domain of development, Unix-based systems such as Linux and macOS frequently garner attention. Nevertheless, the integration of WSL allows smooth coding alongside the utilization of Adobe and Microsoft products that may lack support on Linux. This flexibility, coupled with the ability to handle resource-intensive games beyond macOS capabilities, positions Windows-WSL as an enticing platform, ensuring a well-rounded computing experience for all users, regardless of their workplace constraints.</p> <p>Based on your needs, you can choose your OS.</p>"},{"location":"#project-todo-roadmap","title":"Project TODO / Roadmap","text":"<ul> <li>[ ] Some dotfiles integration (GlazeWM, aerospace, raycast...)</li> <li>[ ] Chezmoi integration</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#docs-site","title":"Docs &amp; site","text":"<ul> <li>[ ] Fix broken README one\u2011liners (curl/wget URLs to this repo) and update URL to main branch</li> <li>[ ] Update <code>mkdocs.yml</code>:</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#quality-ux","title":"Quality &amp; UX","text":"<ul> <li>[ ] Update UX/UI.</li> <li>[ ] Display a checkmark when a package is installed.</li> <li>[ ] Add tests and CI coverage for:</li> <li>[ ] Parsing <code>packages.yaml</code>.</li> <li>[ ] Package manager factory mapping.</li> <li>[ ] Windows/WSL command runner behavior.</li> <li>[x] Docker image to test Arch</li> <li>[ ] Docker image to test Ubuntu</li> <li>[ ] Docker image to test macOS</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#check-the-documentation","title":"Check the documentation","text":"<p>You can check the documentation (website).</p>"},{"location":"#contributing-for-developers","title":"Contributing (For developers)","text":"<p>Check the CONTRIBUTING.md file for more information.</p> <p>Star History Chart </p>"},{"location":"CONTRIBUTING/","title":"Contributing to this project","text":"<p>First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! \u2764\ufe0f</p>"},{"location":"CONTRIBUTING/#1-code-of-conduct","title":"1.

It will automatically detect the ports.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Remote/local terminal &amp; interpreter :<ul> <li>When creating a project with pycharm, you should use the anaconda python (windows or wsl) and not install python   or using another one like virtualenv.</li> <li>You can use ubuntu as default terminal in pycharm: tools&gt;terminal and put in a shell path: <code>ubuntu run</code></li> <li>Add WSL interpreter in Pycharm (add interpreter -&gt; WSL). For example, Conda, installed in WSL, will be available   in Pycharm.</li> <li>You can use docker as an interpreter in Pycharm (If you have a powerful computer like a desktop or a Macbook,   otherwise, a laptop with Windows 11 + WSL2 + pycharm + docker isn't a good idea). To set Docker Port Bindings When   Using Pycharm Run/Debug Go to: Python file &gt; Edit Configuration &gt; Docker container settings (click on open folder   icon) At Edit Docker Container Settings, you can add Port bindings. Or set the python configuration to use this so   all the python files can use the same configuration.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Always use Markdown code and add <code>py</code> to tell the Markdown that it's python code. When you will do refactor. It will   change the python code in the readme.</li> <li>Plugins: You can download plugins from the settings menu. I recommend the following plugins:<ul> <li>GitHub copilot (autocomplete, but also provides functions when you right-click on something like: explain,   generate tests...etc.)</li> <li>default plugins: services with docker...</li> <li>TBD</li> </ul> </li> <li>PyCharm has keyboard shortcuts for most of its commands related to editing, navigation, refactoring, debugging, and   other tasks. Memorizing these hotkeys can help you stay more productive by keeping your hands on the   keyboard. Link to Cheatsheet</li> <li>If the plugin Table of contents doesn't work on a Markdown file, create a small table with the title &amp;   two<code>&lt;!-- TOC --&gt;</code>, it should detect it.</li> <li>Pycharm has fuzzy search when creating a file. For example, 'alt+p' then 'alt+ins' then 'pf' to create a python file</li> <li>(To confirm) Pycharm Jupyter Notebook: Use the one provided in Pycharm. It provides better autocomplete.</li> <li>WriterSide issue : files eit</li>"},{"location":"docs/apps_configuration_and_shorcuts/#192-personal-pycharm-shortcuts","title":"1.9.2.

Go back to AIOStreams, and copy the manifest URL in the 'JackettioFR (custom)' manifest URL field.\n\n          ###### \u2699\ufe0f (optional) reorder the addons and remove Cinemeta catalogs:\n          This will remove the 4 first default catalogs provided by Stremio using their official addon named 'Cinemeta'. We can remove this and controle everything needed using TMDB Addon.\n          1. Go to [cinebye website](https://cinebye.dinsden.top/)\n          2. Go to section #1 Called 'Authenticate' and login using your stremio credentials (or use the auth key with this command in the console in web.stremio.com `JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(\"profile\")).auth.key` )\n          3. Go to section #2 called 'Options' and uncheck these functionalities :\n             - (Optional) Remove Cinemeta Search. (Will be replaced by AIOMetadata search)\n\n             - (Recommended) Remove Cinemeta Catalogs. Will be replaced by TMDB catalogs with the ratingd.\n\n             - (Warning) Remove Cinemeta Metadata. This will break your Trakt Sync and Calendar functionalities.

Go to section #3 Called 'Sync Addons' and click on 'Sync to Stremio'.\n\n          ---\n\n          ##### \ud83d\udcbe Step 7 \u2014 Save and Install\n          1. Go back to the **Install** section.\n          2. Click **Save** \u2014 this saves your configuration to your online AIOStreams account.  If you see a timeout error with the name of an addon, it means that this addon is down right now. Just deactivate it and save again (sometimes StremFusion and Opensubtitles V3+ are down)\n          3. Then click **Install** and choose **Stremio Web** (or your preferred option).\n          4. Stremio will open and prompt you to install your configured addons.\n\n          ---\n\n          ##### \u2705 Step 8 \u2014 Test Everything\n          Open any movie or TV show in Stremio.\n          You should now see your addons providing streams.\n          After selecting a movie, you should see this (Ratings and Statutios appears only if you installed them:\n\n          &lt;img width=\"389\" height=\"719\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fdb37b6a-68f9-4a33-abc6-c1adfd21a699\" /&gt;\n\n          ---\n          As you can see, the streams display clean, readable, and emoji-enhanced stream information inside Stremio. But what does these emojis mean ?\n\n         - \ud83c\udf9e\ufe0f Resolution Badges (From top to worse): \u269c\ufe0f 4K for 2160p, \ud83d\udcc0 1440p, \ud83d\udcc0 1080p ...etc \u26aa N/A if resolution is missing\n\n         - \ud83c\udff7\ufe0f Quality Labels (From top to worse): \ud83d\udcc0 REMUX, \ud83d\udcbf Blu-ray, \ud83c\udf10 WEB-DL, \ud83d\udda5\ufe0f WEBRip, \ud83d\udcbe HDRip / DVDRip / HDTV / TS / TC, \u26aa N/A if no quality tag exists\n\n         - Cached streams: [AD\u26a1\ufe0f]: The lightning symbol means the stream is cached, \u23f3\ufe0f means not cached. It's preferable to select a cached stream because a non-cached stream means that you the debrid service will try to download it, and if there isn't any seeders, you won't be able to stream it.\n\n        ##### \u2705 Step 9 \u2014 Watch an episode of a popular show:\n        - If every stream appears with the \u23f3 (not cached) icon and none show the \u26a1\ufe0f (cached) indicator, it usually means your IP address has not been validated on your AllDebrid account.\n          Some debrid services (including AllDebrid) require you to confirm your current IP before they allow cached torrents to be accessed.\n          So when you start a stream for the first time from a new addon, the service blocks cached access until the IP is verified.\n\n          To fix this:\n\n          Start any stream in Stremio (this triggers the request on the debrid side).\n\n          Go to your debrid service\u2019s website (e.g., AllDebrid).\n\n          You should see a prompt asking you to validate or authorize your IP address.\n\n          Confirm it \u2014 and cached streams will immediately switch from \u23f3 to \u26a1\ufe0f.\n        - Keep your **UUID** and **password** safe \u2014 that\u2019s your AIOStreams login.\n        - You can restore your setup anytime by re-entering your credentials.\n        - AIOStreams makes it easy to sync and manage all your addons from one place.\n        - The order of a list (catalogs) in Stremio home is determined by the installation order (except in AIOSteams were you can order them manually).\n\n       Your Stremio should look like this: &lt;img width=\"1908\" height=\"912\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f5388f6-3a97-4d7a-b5e1-d66eaea07728\" /&gt;\n\n ##### \ud83d\udca1 Stremio Tips\n   -  In Stremio Settings, you can select the prefered 'Audio language' and 'Subtitles'. This will automatically set the audio and subs automatically when you watch something. This is not synced between devices, you need to do it manually on each of your device.\n   -  Use Stremio web to configure addons. ALl settings &amp; addons will sync between your devices if you use the same\n        account.\n   - (Optional) Trakt :\n      - Trakt is a media tracking service that helps users sync their TV shows and movies across numerous platforms and devices.\n      - You can enable trakt in Stremio settings. You can download Trakt mobile app or use their website.\n      - Ratings &amp; history: I rank my movies (and series) on trakt (they will automatically mark as watched if you\n       activate that setting in trakt's website : settings -&gt; Mark Watched After Rating: Automatically mark unwatched\n       items with today's date).\n      - If you didn't rate some movies &amp; tv shows, you can add them to history in Trakt to avoid being recommended by the 'AI Search' addon.\n     - If you want to syncronize Trakt with IMDB you can use [IMDB-Trakt-Syncer](https://github.com/RileyXX/IMDB-Trakt-Syncer). You can rate what you watch on IMDB or trakt and run the python app to sync everything.\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"docs/apps/apps_configuration_and_shorcuts/","title":"Apps configuration and shortcuts","text":"<p>Table of Contents</p> <ul> <li>Apps configuration and shortcuts</li> <li>1.
