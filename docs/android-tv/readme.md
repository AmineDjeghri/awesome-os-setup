# TV Setup (googletv / android tv)
One of the best TV OS is Google TV. Here are some reasons why you should consider using Google TV:
- Sideloading apps is straightforward on Google TV. You can install apps like Stremio, SmartTube, and others.
- It's not as responsive as Apple TV, but you can tweak it to make it faster.
- You can use alternative launchers like 'Projectivy'.

## All TV types:
- My first advice is to never use the standard mode on your TV. Always use the cinema/ filmaker or movie mode. The
  standard mode is too bright and the colors are not accurate. Use the cinema or movie mode when watching movies or
  series.
- Here is a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dY3M_h30HYc) explaining TV modes.
  And [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTO2Wmw1NKA) for changing the settings of your TV taking into
  account different modes (SDR, HDR, Dolby). (You can refer to reddit guides or YouTube videos
  or [rtings.com](https://rtings.com) to find the best settings).
- If your TV supports multiple content types (SDR, HDR, DOLBY), the mode needs to be activated on each content type.
- On some TVs like the Hisense U7k, you need to enable enhanced HDMI mode to access dolby vision & 60HZ on your
  Chromecast and other HDMI inputs.
- If you play video games, use the game mode. It will reduce the input lag and improve the gaming experience.

## Google TV OS:
- (Important) Enhance the performance of your Google TV by following

the Projectivy and add Stremio and Nuvio there. Also make it the default launcher for your tv.

### Best google TV apps:

  -  You can create channels in the menu and add stremio, smartube, spotify to the home screen.
- [Stremio](https://www.stremio.com/) / [Nuvio](https://nuvioapp.space/)
   #### What is Stremio / Nuvio ?
  <img width="1908" height="912" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f5388f6-3a97-4d7a-b5e1-d66eaea07728" />

  - Stremio/Nuvio are video streaming applications that allows you to watch and organize video content from different services,
    including movies, series, live TV and video channels. The content is aggregated by an addon system providing streams
    from various sources. And with its commitment to security, Stremio/Nuvio are the ultimate choice for a worry-free,
    high-quality streaming experience.

  - Stremio is available on all platforms: Web, Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS, Android TV, Apple TV...
  - For 2026, I recommend using Nuvio. Nuvio is recent, full open source and has a lot of features directly integrated in the app. It is compatible with Stremio Addons. It is available on: Android, iOS, Android TV
  - Addons...etc will be synchronized between all your devices.
  - You will use a debrid service (like Real Debrid, All Debrid), so you won't need any VPN.
    What is a debrid service? A debrid service is an unrestricted multi-hoster that allows you to stream and download videos instantly at the best speeds. In plain English, the debrid services act as a proxy between the BitTorrent tracker and you, so you download the content directly from their servers at high speed. Most of the content is already cached, meaning you can instantly access it. Personnaly, I use ALL Debrid, but others exist like : TorBox, Real Debrid...

  #### Installation
  - (Updated February 2026) : This guide applies to Nuvio, but it is also valid for Stremio.
  - First of all, you can do everything with your mobile. It's just better if you have a computer but it's not necessary.
  - If you never used Stremio, I advise you to start with this [fast tutorial](https://arnav.au/2025/04/16/stremio-torrentio-debrid-how-to-guide/)
  - If you want to understand everything, there is [a complete and detailed tutorial](https://guides.viren070.me/stremio/).
  - If you know how to use Stremio, the same steps apply to Nuvio.
  - Setup :
      - Test Stremio/Nuvio with a simple config :
         - Log in with your regular account into Stremio or Nuvio.
         - Subscribe to AllDebrid (or Real Debrid or Torbox). For All Debrid : https://alldebrid.com/ , do not select the free trial, it doesn't work.
         - Configure this addon for example: CometFR addon https://comet.stremiofr.com/ , use the AllDebrid api key.
         - Go back to Stremio/Nuvio -> Addons, install addon -> and copy the manifest URL.
         - Select a movie, you should see the streams (the results to watch a movie). IF not, go to AllDebrid and accept the IP address request.
           
         🚨 IMPORTANT  
         Since addons are hosted in different servers, everytime you add a new addon, you need to go to AllDebrid and validate the IP Address.
         
      - After making any change to any addon, you don't need to close the application to synchronize the changes, just click on the addons tab, and go back to home.
        - My recommended Setup:
          - AIOStreams:

              #### 🌐 AIOStreams + Nuvio Configuration Guide

              ##### 🧩 What is AIOStreams?
              AIOStreams is an all-in-one **Stremio addon manager** that lets you organize, install, and sync all your favorite addons in one place.
              It also allows you to **save your configuration online**, so you don’t lose your setup.

              2. Enter a **password** of your choice — this will create your AIOStreams account.
              3. You’ll receive a **UUID** (like your username).
              4. **Save both the UUID and your password!** You’ll need them to restore or import your configuration later.

              ---

              ##### 📂 Step 4 — Import Your Settings

              3. Enter your API key.
              4. After adding your Debrid api key, go down and look for 'TMDB' and follow the instructions to add your TMDB API keys.

             1. Go back to AIOStreams, and copy the manifest URL in the 'JackettioFR (custom)' manifest URL field.

              ###### ⚙️ (optional - only if you use Stremio) reorder the addons and remove Cinemeta catalogs:
              This will remove the 4 first default catalogs provided by Stremio using their official addon named 'Cinemeta'. We can remove this and controle everything needed using TMDB Addon.

              ---

              ##### 💾 Step 7 — Save and Install
              1. Go back to the **Install** section.
              2. Click **Save** — this saves your configuration to your online AIOStreams account.  If you see a timeout error with the name of an addon, it means that this addon is down right now. Just deactivate it and save again (sometimes StremFusion and Opensubtitles V3+ are down)
              3. Then click **Install** and compy the link to Nuvio/Stremio addons.

              ---

              ##### ✅ Step 8 — Test Everything
              Open any movie or TV show in Nuvio/Stremio.
              You should now see your addons providing streams.
              After selecting a movie, you should see this (Ratings and Statutios appears only if you installed them:

              <img width="389" height="719" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fdb37b6a-68f9-4a33-abc6-c1adfd21a699" />

              ---
              As you can see, the streams display clean, readable, and emoji-enhanced stream information inside Stremio. But what does these emojis mean ?

             - 🎞️ Resolution Badges (From top to worse): ⚜️ 4K for 2160p, 📀 1440p, 📀 1080p ...etc ⚪ N/A if resolution is missing

             - 🏷️ Quality Labels (From top to worse): 📀 REMUX, 💿 Blu-ray, 🌐 WEB-DL, 🖥️ WEBRip, 💾 HDRip / DVDRip / HDTV / TS / TC, ⚪ N/A if no quality tag exists

             - Cached streams: [AD⚡️]: The lightning symbol means the stream is cached, ⏳️ means not cached. It's preferable to select a cached stream because a non-cached stream means that you the debrid service will try to download it, and if there isn't any seeders, you won't be able to stream it.

            ##### ✅ Step 9 — Watch an episode of a popular show:
            - If every stream appears with the ⏳ (not cached) icon and none show the ⚡️ (cached) indicator, it usually means your IP address has not been validated on your AllDebrid account.
              Some debrid services (including AllDebrid) require you to confirm your current IP before they allow cached torrents to be accessed.
              So when you start a stream for the first time from a new addon, the service blocks cached access until the IP is verified.

              To fix this:

              Start any stream in Stremio (this triggers the request on the debrid side).

              Go to your debrid service’s website (e.g., AllDebrid).

              You should see a prompt asking you to validate or authorize your IP address.

              Confirm it — and cached streams will immediately switch from ⏳ to ⚡️.
            - Keep your **UUID** and **password** safe — that’s your AIOStreams login.
            - You can restore your setup anytime by re-entering your credentials.
            - AIOStreams makes it easy to sync and manage all your addons from one place.
            - (Stremio limitation) The order of a list (catalogs) in Stremio home is determined by the installation order (except in AIOSteams were you can order them manually).

           Your Stremio should look like this: <img width="1908" height="912" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f5388f6-3a97-4d7a-b5e1-d66eaea07728" />

     ##### 💡 Nuvio/Stremio Tips
       -  In Stremio Settings, you can select the preferred 'Audio language' and 'Subtitles'. This will automatically set the audio and subs automatically when you watch something. This is not synced between devices, you need to do it manually on each of your device.
       -  Use Stremio web to configure addons. ALl settings & addons will sync between your devices if you use the same
            account.
       - (Optional) Trakt :
          - Trakt is a media tracking service that helps users sync their TV shows and movies across numerous platforms and devices.
          - You can enable trakt in Nuvio/Stremio settings. You can download Trakt mobile app or use their website.
          - Ratings & history: I rank my movies (and series) on trakt (they will automatically mark as watched if you
           activate that setting in Trakt's website : settings -> Mark Watched After Rating: Automatically mark unwatched
           items with today's date).
          - If you didn't rate some movies & tv shows, you can add them to history in Trakt to avoid being recommended by the 'AI Search' addon.
         - If you want to synchronize Trakt with IMDB you can use [IMDB-Trakt-Syncer](https://github.com/RileyXX/IMDB-Trakt-Syncer). You can rate what you watch on IMDB or trakt and run the python app to sync everything.
