## 1. Ubuntu Server 26.04

Before everything.
If this server was your DHCP Server, activate temporarily the DHCP of your router so the machine can get an IP address.

### Setup

- Set up an Ubuntu Server on a laptop.
  - You  better have Ethernet connection. If you only have Wi-Fi, buy a usb  Ethernet adapter. It's worth it, and you will be able to use the bridge mode which is not available with wifi.
  - boot up ubuntu from an usb drive, select the language, keyboard layout, and timezone. In the network section, select the Ethernet connection, an IP 192.168.x.x will be assigned.
  - Wait for mirror to be configured.
  - In storage configuration, select  Entire disk with 'encrypt the LVM group with LUKS'. Since we will install HAOS inside a VM later, create a partition for `/var/lib/libvirt/images`.
  - Install `openssh-server` and manage it remotely using SSH from another machine so you can copy-paste commands from the documentation.
  - enable ssh auto start : `sudo systemctl enable ssh` and  `sudo systemctl start ssh`
### First checks / updates

- Run updates:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade

# if you face an error with CDROM
sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cdrom.sources

sudo apt autoremove -y
```

- Run `ip addr` to check the IP address. This is your HOST-IP. It looks like `192.168.x.x` ( you will have a IPV4 and IPV6 address)
- Run `ping google.com` to check the connection.
- If this machine was your DHCP server. You need to have a static IP, and point to the dns and router gateway (`sudo vim /etc/netplan/01-net.yaml` then set ``dhcp4: no`` and add address, nameserver and dns)
- Connect remotely in the same network using SSH and the server IP from another machine that has a GUI and a browser so you can copy-paste commands from the documentation. You can either use the IPV6 or the IPV4of the server.
  This is because we don't have a DHCP server and since the machine is NOT using DHCP right now (dhcp4:no), the router is NOT giving your server: IP Gateway DNS. And we need to define it manually until we add the DHCP server.
```bash
ssh username@192.168.x.x
```

- I customized the shell environment by installing Zsh and tools from the [Awesome OS Setup](../../README.md) to improve usability and productivity.

### Lid closed (Laptop)

- File: `sudo vim /etc/systemd/logind.conf`
- Change this line: `HandleLidSwitch=ignore` (uncomment it too)
- Restart with `sudo systemctl restart systemd-logind`

## 2. Home Assistant

### Virtualization

- I verified that virtualization was supported on the system, checked Secure Boot status:
  - Run:

```bash
egrep -c '(vmx|svm)' /proc/cpuinfo
```

  Should return a number `> 0`.
- Sometimes it returns `0`. In that case you need to check if Virtualization is enabled in your BIOS to ensure compatibility.
- If you still have `0`, and you are sure that Virtualization is enabled in your BIOS, ignore the `0`.

### Install KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) and libvirt

- Install:

```bash
sudo apt-get install qemu-system-x86 libvirt-daemon-system virtinst \
ovmf swtpm qemu-utils guestfs-tools libosinfo-bin -y
```

- Verify:

```bash
lsmod | grep kvm
sudo kvm-ok
lscpu | grep Virtualization
```

- Check libvirt:

```bash
sudo systemctl status libvirtd
sudo usermod -aG libvirt $USER
sudo usermod -aG kvm $USER
```

#### Create a bridge configuration
A network bridge in KVM allows your virtual machines to appear directly on the same network as your host.

- Without a bridge: VMs often use NAT (Network Address Translation). They can access the internet, but other devices on your LAN cannot access the VMs directly.

- With a bridge: VMs act like physical machines on your network. They get an IP from your router (or DHCP server) just like your host, and other devices can communicate with them directly.

- This works only with Ethernet, not with Wi-Fi.

>> Important:
> The bridge will create new Mac Addresses. So if you had a DHCP with devices that used static IP through the bridge, you will need to update it.
> For adguard, you will need to go to DHCP settings, delete the old client and create a new one in DHCP leases after it detects the new IP address.

How to:
- Identify your network interface with `ip addr`, it should look like `enp0s31f6` or `enx001`  It is where you can see eth0.
- Create a bridge configuration file in `/etc/netplan/` with the following content:
- Create a bridge configuration file with  `sudo vim /etc/netplan/01-bridge.yaml`, replace `enx001cc253c478` with your interface name
```yaml
network:
  version: 2
  renderer: networkd
  ethernets:
    enx001cc253c478:
      dhcp4: no
  bridges:
    br0:
      interfaces: [enx001cc253c478]
      dhcp4: yes
      parameters:
        stp: false
        forward-delay: 0
```

- `sudo chmod 600 /etc/netplan/*.yaml`
- Before applying the configuration with  `sudo netplan apply`, connect physically to the server because the next command will change the ip address of the SSH and your SSH connection will be lost. Or check the IP address of the server in the router.
- Your host’s IP will move from enx001cc253c478 to br0
- Apply the configuration:

```bash
sudo netplan apply
```
If you are connected via SSH, you will probably get disconnected unless the static ip is set.
Go physically to the server (or check the devices in the router) and get the new IP address:

```bash
ip addr
```
Your `interface name` will no longer have a direct IP. All traffic goes through `br0`.
To connect to the server via SSH, you will need to use the ``br0`` address.

Try `ping 8.8.8.8`

### Home Assistant OS in a VM

- Doc: https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/alternative#virtual-machines

- Download the Home Assistant OS image:

```bash
wget https://github.com/home-assistant/operating-system/releases/download/16.3/haos_ova-16.3.qcow2.xz
```

- Move the image to the libvirt directory:

```bash
sudo mv haos_ova-16.3.qcow2.xz /var/lib/libvirt/images/
```

- Uncompress the image:

```bash
sudo xz -d /var/lib/libvirt/images/haos_ova-16.3.qcow2.xz
```

>> Important: we will use sudo so with all the commands later like `virsh list --all` should use sudo ``sudo virsh list --all`` otherwise it will show nothing.
- HAOS runs under system libvirt  and needs to be managed by root and uses /var/lib/libvirt
-

| Feature                      | system (`root`) | user        | Notes / Explanation                                                                                                   |
|------------------------------|-----------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Autostart on boot            | ✅               | ⚠️ Possible | Root/systemd can autostart VMs easily. Users can use `systemd --user` or autostart scripts, but extra setup required. |
| USB passthrough              | ✅               | ⚠️ Possible | Root can attach any USB device. Users can do it if they’re in `libvirt`/`kvm` groups and udev rules allow access.     |
| Bluetooth / Zigbee           | ✅               | ⚠️ Possible | Needs hardware access; root can do it directly. Users need correct groups and permissions.                            |
| Headless server use          | ✅               | ✅           | Works for both. Headless VM does not require GUI.                                                                     |
| Network bridges              | ✅               | ⚠️ Possible | Root can create bridges freely. Users need pre-made bridges or `sudo` for creation.                                   |
| IP forwarding / port mapping | ✅               | ❌           | Modifying `sysctl` and `iptables` requires root. Users cannot forward ports without `sudo`.                           |
| Cloudflare tunnel stability  | ✅               | ✅           | Independent of root vs user. Tunnels are stable as long as service runs correctly.                                    |



- Create the VM: ( we are adding --network bridge=br0) to use the bridge.
If the DHCP server is down, the VM will not get an IP address and will have a lot of problems. Enable temporarily the DHCP server of your router.
```bash
sudo virt-install --name haos --description "Home Assistant OS" --os-variant=generic --ram=4096 --vcpus=2 --disk /var/lib/libvirt/images/haos_ova-16.3.qcow2,bus=scsi --controller type=scsi,model=virtio-scsi --import --graphics none --boot uefi --network bridge=br0,model=virtio --console pty,target_type=serial
```

- Once you see `Welcome to Home Assistant homeassistant login:`, you can quit leave the console using `Ctrl + Alt Gr +]` or Open a new terminal.

- Now we need to check if HAOS is running:
  - `sudo virsh list --all`, you should see the VM running named `haos`
  - Find the IP address of the HAOS VM: From your router’s DHCP table (recommended) on your router app/website. As you can understand, the VM is like a device that is connected to the router, that is why the router assigned it an IP address.
    - The default port is `8123`
    - Check if HAOS is running : open a browser and go to `http://<HAOS-IP>:8123` or use curl: ``curl -v http://<HAOS-IP>:8123``
    - Go to `http://homeassistant.local:8123/`. This is the default address if the name is `homeassistant` in Settings -> System -> Network -> Hostname : `homeassistant` . If the name is something else like 'ha' the address will be `http://ha.local:8123/`.
  - You should see the Home Assistant login page.
  - If you have a backup, select 'Backup' then reboot it with `sudo virsh reboot haos` then go HAOS settings -> Configure network interfaces -> IPv4 -> Static and set the IP address that was previously set .
  - Back on your terminal, activate the autostart: `sudo virsh autostart haos`
  - Check autostart in: `sudo virsh dominfo haos`


You need to differentiate between:

- HOST IP (the IP of the laptop): `ip addr` example: `192.168.1.86`
- VM-IP or HAOS-IP (the IP of the HAOS VM) example: `192.168.1.20` or `homeassistant.local`
- Both have IPs assigned from the router. The HAOS VM uses a bridge, so it gets an IP from the router just like a regular device.
- These IPs can change if we restart the router, we will assign static ip to the VM.

If you want to resize the VM disk:
```bash
sudo qemu-img resize /var/lib/libvirt/images/haos_ova-16.3.qcow2 +20G
```


#### inside HA in your browser or mobile app:

- In your browser, go to  `http://<HOST-IP>:8123`, for example `http://homeassistant.local:8123` or `http://192.168.1.86:8123`.
- Create an account.
- User settings: Profile -> General-> language, date format, number format, etc.
- Check Advanced mode in General settings.
- in User settings, go to Security -> Enable MFA
- In Settings, check for an update for HAOS. After the update it will restart the server.
- In the addon store, click on the three dots on the top right and add this repository: https://github.com/homeassistant-apps/repository
- Set up a static IP for the VM: in HAOS website go to Settings -> System -> Network -> and change IPv4 from auto to static and IPv6 too. You can keep the default ip that is assigned to the VM.

### 2. Accessing HAOS from outside your local network  — Cloudflare Tunnel Setup
- Create a Domain or your domain is already managed by **Cloudflare**
- In HAOS, add the addon `file editor`.
- Follow this video: https://youtu.be/JGAKzzOmvxg
- Don't forget to update and save configuration.yaml
- Restart HAOS
- On you phone, when you add home assistant, add both local and external URL, so you can connect when you are outside
- Adding both local and external URL is important because the external URL is the one that will be used when you are outside your local network.

**Add Cloudflare Access (Zero Trust) ⭐⭐⭐**

This is the single biggest security upgrade. Before showing your Home Assistant app in your browser or mobile, it will force the user to first login via an email or something.
If the User can't log in, he won't be able to see the app.

- You are protecting for example `ha.yourdomain.com`
Go to  Cloudflare Zero Trust -> Access Controls -> Applications -> Self-hosted:

##### 1️⃣ Basic Information (Top Section)

Application name

Use something clear:

- Home Assistant
- (or Home Assistant – Production if you like)

Session Duration

Recommended:

- 24 hours or You can put more

##### 2️⃣ Add Public Hostname (IMPORTANT)

Click Add public hostname.

Fill in:

- Hostname: `ha.yourdomain.com`
- Path: `/*`
- Type: HTTP

👉 This is what actually puts the Access login page in front of Home Assistant.

Do NOT add private IP unless you know you need it.

##### 3️⃣ Browser Rendering Settings

Leave this OFF / untouched.

(Home Assistant does NOT need SSH/RDP/VNC rendering)

##### 4️⃣ Policies (MOST IMPORTANT PART)

Click Add a policy. It will open a new page, and need to go back to this page and refresh it to show the policies.

Policy 1 — Allow yourself (and family)

- Policy name: Allow Home Assistant Users
- Action: Allow

Rules (choose ONE of these methods):

✅ Best option: Email-based

- Include -> Emails -> `your@email.com`
- You can add multiple emails (family members).

✅ Alternative: Identity provider

If using Google / Microsoft / GitHub:

- You can for example add GitHub following [this](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/integrations/identity-providers/github/).
- Adding the integration automatically adds it as a login method to all the applications. Don't add the provider as a login method to the policy, otherwise, it will accept all the users using that provider.
- Keep the emails in the policy. https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/access-controls/policies/#require
- If you want to disable the login, create a policy with action allow and an include rule 'everyone'

❌ Do NOT use:

- “Allow everyone”
- IP-only rules (unless combined with email)
- Country-only rules alone

(Optional but recommended)

- Add Require MFA if available in your plan.

##### 5️⃣ (Optional) Add a Second Policy – Emergency Lockdown

Advanced but useful:

- Policy name: Block High Risk Countries
- Action: Block
- Rule:
  - Include -> Countries -> (countries you NEVER travel to)

Cloudflare evaluates Block after Allow, so this is safe.

##### 6️⃣ Login Methods

You’ll see:

- Accept all available identity providers -> ON

Recommended setting:

✅ Leave this ON if:

- You trust future IdPs
- You are the only admin

OR

🔒 Turn OFF and explicitly select:

- Google
- Email OTP

This is slightly more secure, less future surprise.

##### Go back to the previous page to see the policies
Where you put your domain, choose the policies you added.

##### 7️⃣ Save the Application ✅

Once saved:

- Visiting `ha.yourdomain.com` should show Cloudflare Access login. If it doesn't force refresh the page or clear cookies.
- Only after login -> Home Assistant loads

If you do a restoration, or change something in cloudflare, and you see that you can't view home assistant, delete the cookies and try again.

#### Activate MFA
- In profile -> security, activate MFA

You should now have:

- ✅ Cloudflare Tunnel (no ports open)
- ✅ Cloudflare Access login in front of HA
- ✅ Email (or Google login or GitHub)
- ✅ MFA
- ✅ 1 month session

---

### Home Assistant devices, add-ons, and integrations

- **Integrations**: built into Home Assistant (Settings -> Devices & services).
- **Add-ons (Apps)**: services that run alongside Home Assistant OS (AdguardHome,Cloudflared...etc).
- **Repositories**: additional catalogs for community add-ons and integrations (example: HACS).

Notes:

- Always search for an open-source integration before using a proprietary app. For example: TP-link, Dreame, LG ThinQ, Bosch Home Connect have open-source integrations and are far better than the proprietary apps.
- Some devices still need their vendor app for initial setup or extra features (example: LG, Bosch). It’s fine to keep the app installed even if you control the device later in Home Assistant.

#### Matter over Wi-Fi

-  TBD

#### Matter over Thread and Zigbee devices

- If the device does Matter over Thread, you will need a Thread Border Router (TBR) on your network. Personally, I recommend [Sonoff MG24](https://www.amazon.fr/SONOFF-Dongle-PMG24-Dongle-Plus-MG24/dp/B0FMJD288B) . It even supports both Thread and Zigbee and the same time.
- Do not use Aqara M100 because it is proprietary and not well-supported in Home Assistant.

How to setup Sonoff MG24:

 - Attach to usb port, run `usb-devices` on ubuntu and get Vendor and ProdID.
 - Run:

 ```sh
sudo virsh attach-device haos /dev/stdin --persistent <<EOF
<hostdev mode='subsystem' type='usb' managed='yes'>
  <source>
    <vendor id='0x10c4'/>
    <product id='0xea60'/>
  </source>
</hostdev>
EOF
 ```

 Or using the bus and device:

 ```sh
sudo virsh attach-device haos /dev/stdin --persistent <<EOF
<hostdev mode='subsystem' type='usb' managed='yes'>
 <source>
   <address bus='1' device='12'/>
 </source>
</hostdev>
EOF
 ```

 - Run `sudo virsh reboot haos`.
 - Go to Home Assistant -> Settings -> System -> Hardware -> All Hardware -> search for `Sonoff`.
 - Flash it using this [tutorial](https://blog.dautek.fr/comment-installer-le-dongle-zigbee-et-thread-sonoff-mg24-sur-home-assistant).

 If you want only thread: flash Sonoff for thread only.

 If you want both Thread controller and Zigbee, use Multipan with the MG24. Tutorials:

 ### Apps / Add-ons

* **AdGuard Home**
  * DNS and DHCP (do not forget to add IPv4 and IPv6 DNS servers to your router). Disable safe search.
  * For IP address name resolving, check [this section](#adguard-home-address-naming-resolution-using-the-router-freebox).
  * Docs/repo: https://github.com/hassio-addons/addon-adguard-home
  * Add Google and Cloudflare DNS servers (both IPV4 and IPV6) as 2nd and 3rd options incase the self-hosted AdGuard Home breaks.
  * Make heavy tests (Restart the server, restart HA, restart the router, cut the power off...) after setting AdGuard Home because if something breaks, you will not be able to access your home assistant.


* [Cloudflared](https://github.com/homeassistant-apps/app-cloudflared) (Cloudflare Tunnel)
  - Create tunnels for the addons that you want. For example an app running on http://homeassistant.local:8081

* [Home Assistant Community Store (HACS)](https://www.hacs.xyz/)

* [Home Assistant Google Drive Backup](https://github.com/sabeechen/hassio-google-drive-backup)
    * Backup everything except media.
    * Test the backup at least once: https://youtu.be/xXXW7sQ9rqs?t=274
    * Backup keeps everything, even addons configuration (delete cookies if the login page is not showing on your domain name).
    * Samba backup add-on: https://github.com/thomasmauerer/hassio-addons/tree/master/samba-backup
    * After a restoration, everything should work as expected:
        * Clean cookies in your browser because of Cloudflare.
        * The Sonoff MG24 can be unrecognized: wait a bit; if still not recognized, detach it and attach it again.

* [Linky](https://github.com/bokub/ha-linky)

* [motionEye](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/motioneye/)

* Music/Audio addons :
  * [Navidrome](https://github.com/alexbelgium/hassio-addons/tree/master/navidrome)
  * [Octo-Fiesta](https://github.com/AmineDjeghri/ha-addons/tree/main/addons/octo-fiesta)
  * Use it with Octo-Fiesta (and [Tidal](https://tidal.squid.wtf/) as a backend)
  * Music Assistant Addon
  * Clients : https://www.navidrome.org/apps/
    * For example Narjo for iOS
  * Auto tagger : Beets
  * You can check this [music server setup](music_server.md)


* [n8n](https://github.com/Rbillon59/hass-n8n)
Update the config of the addon if you want to use the (forms and chat...etc) since they rely on webhooks and the api :
  * In network enable both ports.
  * Update the config of the addon. Since we changed the N8N_EDITOR_BASE_URL, you will not be able to access it from HAOS Ingress. You must use the new address.
  ```yaml
  timezone: Europe/Paris
  env_vars_list:
    - "WEBHOOK_URL: http://homeassistant.local:8081/"
    - "N8N_PATH: /"
    - "N8N_EDITOR_BASE_URL: http://homeassistant.local:5678/"
  cmd_line_args: ""
  ```

It is better to use an external WEBHOOK_URL for the api so external applications can use it.

* HA Label State: https://github.com/andrew-codechimp/HA-Label-State
  * Create two helpers for : entities & addons(apps) with 4 status: off,unavailable, unknown, not_home (away=not_home in raw format)
  * You need to always look at the raw format of the state to see the status of the entity or addon. For example IKEA water-leak sensor's translated status is 'Dry' but the raw format is 'off'. But when the detector is really off, the state is 'unavailable' so our automation can still be triggered.
  * Example [addons_offline.yaml](../../src/awesome_os/config/unix/home_server-and-home_assistant/automations_with_label_state/addons_offline.yaml) & [low_battery.yaml](../../src/awesome_os/config/unix/home_server-and-home_assistant/automations_with_label_state/low_battery.yaml)

### Automations, Scenes, Script, Helpers and Entities
* **🤖 Automation** = When something happens → do something
    * Always use entities instead of devices. Entities have unique names.
* **🎬 Scene** = Rarely used. Set things to a predefined state. A scene is just a snapshot of states.
    * Script: is a sequence of actions that can be triggered by an automation or manually.
* **👉 Automations** trigger scenes
* An example : I want to arm the alarm when I leave my home
    * Automation 1 : if my phone is not available in home assistant (using freebox device tracker) -> Call a script to arm the alarm,
    * Script 1: turn on the alarm, turn on the lock of doors, activate the camera's high motion detections ..etc
    * Automation 2: if the alarm is triggered -> send notifications, run sound on the alarm ...
* **Scripts** are usually created so we can activate them manually or with an automation. They don't have conditions.

* **Helpers**
    * [HA Label State](https://github.com/andrew-codechimp/HA-Label-State)

* **Entities**
    * When you add an entity, you can select a default behavior (toggle , show info, etc..) . For example a camera move down button, the default behavior is to ``show more info``, but you can change it to ``toggle`` so when you press that button, it will move the camera.
    * Show offline devices and addons : Add a filter card that shows 'not_home' and 'unavailable' entities and addons. You need to go to an addon in devices, and enable the 'running' entity to be able to use it in the card.
    * When you rename a device, you can auto recreate the IDs. Changing the entity id doesn't propagate in scripts and automation so before changing the id of an entity, click on related, open in new tabs all the related stuff , change the id then change the id in the related stuff
    * Use labels to group entities. For example, an 'entity status' label and 'addon status' label to detect offline devices and addons without the need to add each device in the condition. You need the


## AdGuard Home address naming resolution using the router (Freebox)
- You must have ONLY ONE DHCP server on the network
- adguard can be used as DNS and DHCP. If so, Go to Freebox Settings -> DHCP -> first, put your  Adguard DNS server, save then deactivate the DHCP server then save again.
- Check the address here
- Don't touch the IPV6 settings.
- Set static IPs in adguard Home. If  you previously had devices using a bridge network, and you did reset that bridge, check again their mac addresses and set static IPs in adguard home and restart the network / devices .
- Restart the router. (Make sure the router DHCP is off and the DNS is pointing to the AdGuard Home)
- The following will show you how to get the names of the devices in AdGuard home using your router (this example is for Freebox API).
- You will notice that your AdGuard Home (AGH) logs contains anonymous entries like "FREE SAS" or raw IPv6 addresses (e.g., fe80::...).
- We create a Python script on Ubuntu that will get all the information from the Freebox API and send it to the AdGuard Home API.
- Steps:
  - In the addon configuration in HA: open the port 8082, you should access the dashboard without authentication on ``HA-IP:8082``. the username and password are your Home assistant username and password (you can create a user named 'adguard' for it).
  - Put the following scripts in the server:
    - [freebox_auth.py](../../src/awesome_os/config/unix/home_server-and-home_assistant/freebox_auth.py)
    - [sync_adguard_home_ip_mac.py](../../src/awesome_os/config/unix/home_server-and-home_assistant/sync_adguard_home_ip_mac.py)
  - I am using Freebox pop as a router, so I use the script [freebox_auth.py](../../src/awesome_os/config/unix/home%20server%20and%20home%20assistant/freebox_auth.py) to get the token ``uv run freebox_auth.py``
  - then I use this script in the server to automatically update Adguard home: [sync_adguard_home_ip_mac.py](../../src/awesome_os/config/unix/home%20server%20and%20home%20assistant/sync_adguard_home_ip_mac.py) to automatically resolve IPV6 addresses and clients names. ``uv run sync_adguard_home_ip_mac.py``
  - Make a cronjob for it by adding this line at the end of ``crontab -e`` (change the path of uv and the script)
````sh
# For example
* * * * * /home/amine/.local/bin/uv run sync_adguard_home_ip_mac.py
````

- Check Settings -> Client settings -> **Persistent clients settings** .
- This script will run every minute. If it discovers a new device, it will update the log file ``sync_agh.log`` with the latest sync information.

- backup vm
- Lan architecture : Router Freebox = Honor Router 3  (bridge) - Ubuntu server (HAOS ( Adguard DNS + DHCP + Script for IPV6 update & naming resolution))
