# TV Setup
One of the best TV OS is Google TV. Here are some reasons why you should consider using Google TV:
- Sideloading apps is straightforward on Google TV. You can install apps like Stremio, SmartTube, and others.
- It's not as responsive as Apple TV, but you can tweak it to make it faster.
- You can use alternative launchers like 'Projectivy'.

## All TV types:
- My first advice is to never use the standard mode on your TV. Always use the cinema/ filmaker or movie mode. The
  standard mode is too bright and the colors are not accurate. Use the cinema or movie mode when watching movies or
  series.
- Here is a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dY3M_h30HYc) explaining TV modes.
  And [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTO2Wmw1NKA) for changing the settings of your TV taking into
  account different modes (SDR, HDR, Dolby). (You can refer to reddit guides or YouTube videos
  or [rtings.com](rtings.com) to find the best settings).
- If your TV supports multiple content types (SDR, HDR, DOLBY), the mode needs to be activated on each content type.
- On some TVs like the Hisense U7k, you need to enable enhanced HDMI mode to access dolby vision & 60HZ on your
  chromecast and other HDMI inputs.
- If you play video games, use the game mode. It will reduce the input lag and improve the gaming experience.

## Google TV OS:
- (Important) Enhance the performance of your Google TV by following

   #### What is Stremio ?

  - Stremio is a video streaming application that allows you to watch and organize video content from different services,
    including movies, series, live TV and video channels. The content is aggregated by an addon system providing streams
    from various sources. And with its commitment to security, Stremio is the ultimate choice for a worry-free,
    high-quality streaming experience.
  - You can either use your favorite platforms to watch movies or series or use torrent without any risk.
  - Stremio is available on all platforms: Web, Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS, Android TV, Apple TV...
  - Addons...etc will be synchronized between all your devices.
  - (Depreated) [Tutorial](https://www.reddit.com/r/StremioAddons/comments/17833ms/stremio_all_you_need_to_know/)
  - You will use a debrid service (like Real Debrid, All Debrid), so you won't need any VPN. 
    What is a debrid service? A debrid service is an unrestricted multi-hoster that allows you to stream and download videos instantly at the best speeds. In plain English, the debrid services act as a proxy between the BitTorrent tracker and you, so you download the content directly from their servers at high speed. Most of the content is already cached, meaning you can instantly access it. Personnaly, I use ALL Debrid, but others exist like : TorBox, Real Debrid...
  
  #### Installation
  - (Update November 2025)
  - Setup :
      - After making any change to any addon, you don't need to close the application to synchronize the changes, just click on the addons tab, and go back to home.
      - My recommended Setup: 
        - AIOStreams:
  
            #### 🌐 AIOStreams + Stremio Configuration Guide
  
            ##### 🧩 What is AIOStreams?
            AIOStreams is an all-in-one **Stremio addon manager** that lets you organize, install, and sync all your favorite addons in one place.  
            It also allows you to **save your configuration online**, so you don’t lose your setup.  
  
            Your data is linked to a **UUID** (your unique ID) and a **password**, so you can restore your configuration anytime.

            Your can also use the [AIOStreams (ElfHosted)](https://aiostreams.elfhosted.com/) but it is limited to 10 addons and there is no Torrentio support.
  
            This page is where you manage everything related to your addons.

            ##### 🧱 Step 3 — Create Your Configuration
            1. Go to the **“Save and Install”** section.  
            2. Enter a **password** of your choice — this will create your AIOStreams account.  
            3. You’ll receive a **UUID** (like your username).  
            4. **Save both the UUID and your password!** You’ll need them to restore or import your configuration later.
  
            ---
  
            ##### 📂 Step 4 — Import Your Settings 
            1. Download[ my configuration file](aiostreams-config.json)

            2. Enable your preferred **Debrid service** (e.g.,  AllDebrid, Real-Debrid, TorBox).  I am using All Debrid, if you choose another Debrid provider, you will need to edit the provider in each addon (which is very easy since it's just a select box)
            3. Enter your API key.  
            4. After adding your Debrid api key, go down and look for 'TMDB' and follow the instructions to add your TMDB API keys.

            ---
  
            ##### 💡 Tips
            - Keep your **UUID** and **password** safe — that’s your AIOStreams login.  
            - You can restore your setup anytime by re-entering your credentials.  
            - AIOStreams makes it easy to sync and manage all your addons from one place.


         
       -  In Stremio Settings, you can select the prefered 'Audio language' and 'Subtitles'. This will automatically set the audio and subs automatically when you watch something. This is not synced between devices, you need to do it manually on each of your device.
       - (Optional) Trakt :
          - Trakt is a media tracking service that helps users sync their TV shows and movies across numerous platforms and devices.
          - You can enable trakt in Stremio settings. You can download Trakt mobile app or use their website. 
         - Ratings & history: I rank my movies (and series) on trakt (they will automatically mark as watched if you
           activate that setting in trakt's website : settings -> Mark Watched After Rating: Automatically mark unwatched
           items with today's date).
         - If you want to syncronize everything with IMDB and/or the streaming platforms, you can use these two
           applications:
             - [IMDB-Trakt-Syncer](https://github.com/RileyXX/IMDB-Trakt-Syncer)a python app to synchronize IMDB ratings,
               watchlist...)  You can rate what you watch on IMDB or trakt and run the python app to sync everything.
  
    Tips :
      - Use Stremio web to configure addons. ALl settings & addons will sync between your devices if you use the same
        account.
      - Order of a list(catalogà in Stremio home is determined by the installation order (except in AIOSteams were you can order them manually).
      -
      - If you didn't rate some movies & tv shows, you can add them to history in Trakt to avoid being recommended by the 'AI Search' addon.


     Your Stremio should look like this:
